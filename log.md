## candel stick plot true tracker function

#TODO:
# - make a tracer col thats based on true entry and exit
 - plot all the ma's
 - turn it into function 
 - MAKE IT plug into a OUTPUT SIGNALS function
     > for exploritory anylsis
     > this is a good idea for all differnt types of strats 
     >so the plotting is optional 
 - use the OUTPUT SIGNALS function to determain the best paramiters to iterate through


## add atr targets to strat - triggered from confirmatioin

- atr function
- with strat ouput
- compile it 

## at atr entrys - for when all ma's are above each other



## add rsi- corner paramater



## plot different versions side by side

# Plot1 - smac
 Plot - Confirmation - Validation
 plot - Confirmation - validation -w smac
 plot - confirmation - validation -w atr targets
 plot - con - val -w atr sLAPS ( pullbacks )
 plot - con-val-atr-rsi

## orginize loops - and storing results

 - do this in a copy notebook
 - doing variations on these higher levels will make it easier 
#   to isolate better paramaters for the next set of loops

## save output function

>literally will just take anything having to do with the results
>and out put a directory for that spread sheet in the same directory
>THEN YOU CAN MAKE A CLEAR OUTPUT AND GRAB THE NEXT SHEET FUNCTION
>LITERALLY THE ENTIRE WORKLOAD WILL BE ABLE TO BE DONE IN ONE DIRECORY 


# what if you use volume waited avg's instead? ....
## ...
### ..
#### .

# all you have to do is make a variation of the smac out put fucntion
# thAT USES pta.VWAP(xxx) instead of .rolling.mean(xxx)
 - plot them side by side

# <---- PUT IT ON GIT HUB!!! ---->



## APPLY SUPER_TRADES CONDITIONS


 - variations of strats
     > 5ema
    > stochastic moves
     > tripple con- val
    > buying pull backs
     > riz-swings
 -  variations of interpreting supertrades
     > if it ever got mentioned
     > mention thresh is > (x)
     > mention thresh is > (x) within (x) days after..

# PILLAGE TWITTER FOR TWEETS - users with followers > (x)
## PROCEDURE: 
- 1.copy the superscrape programs in develop directory
- 2. combine old and new archive
- 3. save the rolling plot
- 4. make the rolling an adjustable script
- 5. run variations
# THINGS TO ADD : Ultimate AHDH List Manager
- 1. it says what time youll be done and how long the list is
- 2. it shows how much time its going to take (while your making the list
- 3. saves the current list for a recall function 
>so you can pick your list back up
